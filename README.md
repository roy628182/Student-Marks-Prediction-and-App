# Student-Marks-Prediction-and-App
A web application built using Streamlit that predicts student marks based on their past performance and other factors. The app uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of student marks.

**Features**

- Predicts student marks based on their past performance and other factors
- Allows users to input their own data and receive predictions
- Provides a dashboard for viewing past predictions and performance
- Includes a feature for comparing predicted marks with actual marks

**Technologies Used**

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Python
- Machine Learning Library: Scikit-learn
- Database: Pandas

**Machine Learning Model**

- The app uses a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset of student marks
- The model takes into account several features, including:
    - Past marks
    - Attendance
    - Assignment scores
    - Exam scores

**Dataset**

- The dataset used to train the model consists of:
    - 1000 student records
    - 10 features (including past marks, attendance, assignment scores, etc.)
    - 1 target variable (predicted marks)

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
3. Run the app using streamlit run (link unavailable)
